      It started as a simple idea. What would it take to go WWOOF
      for 1 week on a farm, in every state, for a year. A simple idea...
      and then it grew

      I wanted to try and include my software development skills as a set out
      on this adventure. Which is where I am today, sitting at home coding
      out this page that you are now looking at

      And as time goes forward I am looking for feedback and ideas for how
      to make a trip like this into a truely once in a lifetime experience

      Every week on technology day I will spend time transforming my field notes into a digestable blog post detailing the weeks events. My hope is that with all the different things to learn and the different plants, animals and things that I will be helping with, there will be no shortage of things to write about.

    <div class="section book">
      <!-- Book by Arthur Shlain from the Noun Project -->
      <%= image_tag('book.png', class: 'footer-image') %>
      By the end of the year I hope to (if logic stands) have a collection of 50 blog posts describing the trip. From that point it will only take some crossing of I's and dotting of T's to turn those blog posts into a book that I can then sell on amazon.

    <div class="section youtube">
      <!-- play by Souvik Maity from the Noun Project -->
      <%= image_tag('youtube.png', class: 'footer-image') %>
      The other way that I would document the trip would be through live YouTube streams once a week from the new location that I am in. I am also thinking it would be fun to bring my drone and get some awesome arial videography.
